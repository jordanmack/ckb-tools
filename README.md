[CKB.tools](https://ckb.tools/) is a online collection of free development tools created for use on Nervos Network.

## Developing

These instructions describe how to launch, run, and develop using the CKB.tools code base.

If you don't need to develop and just want to use the tools, visit the [CKB.tools](https://ckb.tools/) website.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Install Dependencies

**Note: You will need to delete the following file due to a problem in the NPM package.**

```sh
rm -f node_modules/hookrouter/dist/index.d.ts
```

```
